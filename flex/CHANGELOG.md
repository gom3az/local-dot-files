## [Unreleased]

Network-dialog cutover: Waybar's network click now opens `flex wifi` instead of
a script that could only print "nmtui is not installed". The picker keeps the
rofi dialog's affordances (radio on/off, disconnect, signal/security per
network) as flex rows, and `nmcli` still owns every side effect.
Wallpaper cutover: the last fzf surface (`SUPER+W`) is now `flex wallpaper`.
The picker lists the same images the bash script did and shows the focused one
in a kitty-graphics preview pane, so previews survive the move off
`kitty +kitten icat`.

Wiremix compliance pass: flex now renders the upstream design system at
commit `cbdc90f` instead of an approximation of it. `Docs/design_system.md` is
rewritten with a `file:line` citation per rule, and `tests/compliance.rs` pins
one assertion per citation.

Workspace split: `flex/` is now a cargo workspace, cut along the line that
matters for reuse. **`flex-core`** is the engine — rendering, filtering, keys,
the design system, kitty-graphics previews — with no machine-specific path, so
`cargo package -p flex-core` produces a publishable crate. **`flex-rice`** is
this rice's glue: the eight providers, the `flex` binary and the wrappers,
marked `publish = false`. Dependencies run one way, and the engine's last reach
into providers is gone: `Menu::tick`'s hardcoded `center`/`wifi` dispatch is
now the `Menu::on_tick` seam taking a `TickHook`, with `flex-rice::menu()`
installing the dispatcher (build menus with it, or those two providers stop
refreshing). Every test kept its subject — 331 pass, with the same per-suite
counts as before — the wrappers stay covered by Rust tests in
`flex-rice/tests`, and the binary still lands at `target/release/flex`, so the
`~/.local/bin/flex` symlink and all 13 wrapper references are untouched.

Engine extraction: `flex-core` now lives in its own repository,
[gom3az/flex-core], and is consumed here as a git dependency pinned by tag
(`flex-core = { git = …, tag = "v1.0.0" }` in `[workspace.dependencies]`;
`Cargo.lock` pins the exact revision, `777d6fc`). The extracted crate is
unchanged apart from a standalone manifest and its `repository` URL, builds and
passes its 109 tests on its own, and packages cleanly. What stays here is the
rice half: `flex-rice` (providers, `flex` binary, wrappers) with its 222 tests.
The workspace root is kept with a single member **on purpose** — it pins
`target/` at `flex/target/`, which `~/.local/bin/flex` resolves through, and
keeps `flex-rice/wrappers/` where the 13 config references and
`tests/wrappers.rs` expect it. Flattening `flex-rice/` into `flex/` would move
the wrappers and break every keybind, which `04e2599` demonstrated.

`flex-core` has no CI yet: pushing `.github/workflows/` needs a GitHub token
with the `workflow` scope, which this checkout's token lacks. The workflow
(fmt → clippy `-D warnings` → test) is written and ready to add.

### Added
- `flex wifi` provider (`src/providers/wifi.rs`): the network dialog. Rows are
  `Turn Wi-Fi Off`/`Turn Wi-Fi On` (radio state read from `nmcli radio wifi`,
  command as meta), `Disconnect from {ssid}` when a scan reports `IN-USE` `*`,
  then one row per scanned network (id `wifi`, label = SSID, meta = the
  column layout below). Standard rows (the meta column is the point),
  filterable, never deletable. Degradation matches the `center` `Networks`
  tab: failed `nmcli` or no Wi-Fi device → one dim `— offline` row, empty scan
  → the bash `(No Wi-Fi networks)` parenthetical, radio down → only
  `Turn Wi-Fi On`. `$WIFI_RADIO_FILE`/`$WIFI_NMCLI_DEVICES_FILE`/
  `$WIFI_NMCLI_WIFI_FILE` are the fixture seams (shared `center::snapshot`
  contract).
- `wrappers/flex-wifi.sh`: popup wrapper for `flex wifi` (compact `menu`
  variant). Owns every `nmcli` call: radio on/off, `device disconnect`,
  open-network connect, and the `/dev/tty` password prompt for secured
  networks (`FLEX_WIFI_PASSWORD` seam); selecting the network you are already
  on disconnects it, like the rofi picker. `NMCLI`/`NOTIFY_SEND` override the
  commands for tests.
- `tests/wifi.rs` (39 tests): fixture row-set parity, offline/empty/radio-off
  degradation, the live `$WIFI_*` seam path, instant-open/placeholder/scan-swap
  behaviour, saved-profile prompting (profile reuse, ethernet namesakes,
  rejected credentials) + state markers, key-seq replays
  (filter/navigate/Esc/delete-dead), the 80x24 standard-mode golden, and
  stubbed-pipeline wrapper dispatch (open/secure/saved/backslash-label/
  connected-toggle/noop/cancel/malformed/unknown). `tests/wrappers.rs` covers
  the new wrapper.
- Instant `flex wifi` opening (`wifi::menu`): the picker is built from the
  cached scan (`nmcli … --rescan no`: measured 10 ms vs ~3 s for a triggered
  scan), so the first frame lands in ~30 ms instead of after a blocking scan.
  A background thread runs the real scan and `wifi::refresh_scan` — the `wifi`
  branch of `Menu::tick` — swaps its rows in; focus follows the SSID (matched
  by id + label, read through the filter) and lands on the first network when
  the placeholder is replaced. On a cold cache the list shows a dim
  `Scanning…` row instead of claiming `(No Wi-Fi networks)`; the wrapper's
  connect probe now also reads the cache (`--rescan no`), so Enter no longer
  waits for a second scan.
- `flex-wifi.sh` post-TUI feedback: the password prompt is printed explicitly
  (`Password for <ssid>: ` on stderr, which *is* the popup's terminal) instead
  of relying on `read -p`, whose prompt goes to stderr and was being sent to
  `/dev/null` — the popup used to sit blank and look hung while it waited. An
  empty answer now says `No password entered — not connecting to <ssid>.`
  rather than exiting silently, and `Connecting to <ssid>…` covers the
  multi-second `nmcli` connect.
- `flex wifi` row metas use single-cell Nerd Font lock icons
  (`wifi::security_text`, `nf-fa-lock`/`nf-fa-unlock` — the glyphs the deleted
  rofi picker used) instead of the `🔒`/`🔓` emoji, which no part of the UI font
  covers: those resolve to a colour-emoji fallback font, so they land at emoji
  metrics inside Noto Sans Nerd Font rows and break the meta column.
  `center::wifi_meta_body` keeps the emoji for bash parity (its metas are not
  rendered — the `Networks` tab is bare-rows).
- Saved networks no longer ask for a password. `flex-wifi.sh` reconnected from
  the stored profile whenever `nmcli … connection show` lists an
  `802-11-wireless` profile for that SSID (`is_saved`, name split against the
  last colon so `My\:Net` survives), and only prompts when there is no profile
  or when the stored credentials are rejected — stating that fallback
  (`Saved credentials for <ssid> were rejected — enter the password.`) instead
  of failing silently. The picker shows the state in the meta's own column:
  `Connected`, `Saved`, or nothing (`wifi::state_marker`,
  `wifi::parse_saved_profiles`, `$WIFI_NMCLI_PROFILES_FILE` seam).
- `wifi::net_meta` lays the network metas out in **fixed sub-columns**, because
  the renderer right-aligns one string per row: the signal is padded to three
  digits, the bar is a fixed width, the security class is padded to the widest
  in the list, and the state column (`Connected`/`Saved`) occupies reserved
  cells, so every field lines up down the list instead of each row shifting by
  its own suffix:

  ```text
  100% [████████]   WPA1 WPA2  Connected
   79% [██████░░]   WPA2       Saved
   42% [███░░░░░]   Open
  ```
- `wifi::Snapshot` bundles the four `nmcli` reads the picker is built from
  (radio, devices, scan, saved profiles) into one value, so the row builders
  take a snapshot instead of positional `Option<&str>` arguments.
- `flex wallpaper` provider (`src/providers/wallpaper.rs`) with
  `wallpaper-picker.sh` row-set parity: the two bash roots
  (`~/Pictures/Wallpapers`, `~/Pictures/Screenshots`, `WALLPAPER_DIRS`
  override), `find -maxdepth 2 -type f -iname` semantics (four suffixes,
  symlinks skipped like `find` without `-L`), `sort -u` order, basename
  labels, source-directory meta plus `  Active` on the wallpaper in use
  (`set-wallpaper.sh`'s cache file, `hyprpaper.conf` fallback). Ids are
  FNV-1a hex of the absolute path, like `clip`'s content hashes, so the
  space-delimited `ACTION:` line stays parseable; the hidden
  `flex wallpaper --resolve <id>` lookup turns one back into a path.
- `src/preview.rs`: kitty-graphics preview pane. Pure geometry
  (`preview::pane`, 45 % of the frame, right-aligned, one gutter column,
  dropped on frames under 40 columns), protocol escapes
  (`a=T,f=100,t=f,…,C=1,q=2`, single fixed image id, `<path>` as the base64
  payload), and a derived-PNG cache for sources the protocol cannot carry.
  `Row::preview_image` + `Menu::preview` gate it; `render::preview_area` and
  `render::cursor_position` hand the geometry to the event loop, which paints
  after the frame flush and re-parks the caret. `FLEX_PREVIEW=0|1`,
  `FLEX_PREVIEW_CACHE`, `FLEX_PREVIEW_CONVERT` are the environmental seams;
  a pane that cannot be drawn stays blank and logs one stderr line.
- `wrappers/flex-wallpaper.sh`: resolves the id (rejecting anything that is
  not a 16-char hex hash), checks the file, then hands the path to
  `set-wallpaper.sh` (`SET_WALLPAPER` override) after the TUI exits.
  `tests/wallpaper.rs` (21 tests: row/scan/resolve parity, pane geometry and
  goldens, key-seq replays, determinism, stubbed wrapper dispatch) + 20 unit
  tests in `preview.rs`/`wallpaper.rs`; `tests/wrappers.rs` covers the new
  wrapper's exec bit and popup re-exec.

### Fixed
- Preview images keep their aspect ratio. kitty stretches its payload to fill
  the `c`×`r` box exactly — it does not letterbox — and terminal cells are not
  square, so the pane-shaped box squashed landscape wallpapers into a tall
  smear (a 4:1 test image measured 568×1096 px, aspect 0.52). The pane now
  derives an aspect-correct, area-preferred cell box from the transmitted
  PNG's `IHDR` size and the terminal's cell size, and centres it with
  whole-cell shifts plus sub-cell `X`/`Y` offsets. Re-measured live: 4:1 →
  4.06, 1:4 → 0.25, 16:9 → 1.76, 3:2 JPEG through the converter → 1.53.

### Changed
- `render` reserves the preview pane on the right of the list area only —
  rows, filter line, hints, gauge and tab bar keep their upstream geometry, so
  without `Menu::preview` (every other provider) frames are byte-identical.
- `SUPER+W` now runs `flex-wallpaper.sh` instead of `wallpaper-picker.sh`.
- Picking an image no longer regenerates the theme. `set-wallpaper.sh` dropped
  its `generate-theme.sh` call, so `flex wallpaper` swaps the hyprpaper image
  and leaves the current colors alone; themes change only through `flex theme`
  or an explicit `generate-theme.sh` run. `generate-theme.sh` also lost its
  default `auto` name — an unnamed run refreshes `current/` in place and only
  `--save-as <name>` writes to `available/`.
- Waybar's `network` module `on-click` now runs
  `$HOME/dotfiles/flex/wrappers/flex-wifi.sh`; the 5 s `exec` speed probe on
  the same module is untouched. `rofi/.config/rofi/scripts/wifi.sh` became a
  delegating stub to the wrapper (same pattern as `wallpaper-picker.sh`), so
  binds and scripts that call the old path kept working; `wifi.rasi` and
  `wifi-prompt.rasi` became unused rofi assets.

  *Superseded 2026-09-15:* the whole `rofi` stow package was removed
  (`stow -D rofi`), including that stub and both unused `.rasi` assets — the
  stub had no remaining callers once Waybar was repointed. The RASI pipeline
  followed: `generate_rasi()` (and `generate-static-theme.sh`'s heredoc) are
  gone, `colors.rasi` is out of the saved-theme file list and out of
  `theme-switcher.sh`'s theme-validity check, and the `colors.rasi`/
  `theme.rasi` assets were deleted from every saved theme.

### Removed
- `scripts/.config/scripts/patch-ml4w-wallpaper.sh` (it appended a
  `generate-theme.sh` hook to `~/.config/ml4w/scripts/ml4w-wallpaper`, so
  ML4W-driven wallpaper changes regenerated the theme too) and the 16
  `themes/.config/themes/available/auto-*` themes left behind by the old
  picker flow. `available/` now holds only the three static themes.
- `scripts/.config/scripts/picker-chrome.sh` (fzf chrome; its only sourcer was
  the wallpaper picker). `wallpaper-picker.sh` stays as a delegating stub to
  `flex-wallpaper.sh`, like `cliphist.sh pick()` and `theme-switcher.sh
  pick()`.

- `src/meter.rs`: port of upstream `meter.rs` (-60..+6 dB normalisation,
  inactive/active/overload segments, stereo left/live/right and mono layouts).
  `Row::peaks` feeds it; `--peaks off|mono|auto` matches upstream.
- `src/charset.rs`: the three built-in glyph sets (`default`, `compat`,
  `extracompat`) with upstream's exact values, shipped as `const` tables and
  selected by `--char-set`.
- Target dropdowns: `Target`, `Row::targets`/`target_index`, per-tab
  `DropdownState`, upstream geometry (width = longest target + 4, height =
  min(5, n) + 2, right-aligned one row above the selected entry), `Clear` +
  Rounded border, `> ` highlight symbol, `REVERSED` highlight, `•••` scroll
  markers, and `ACTION:TARGET <provider> <row> <target> <title>` reporting.
  Rows with targets open the list on `Enter`/`c`; `Esc` cancels.
- `•••` list scroll indicators in the reserved header/footer lines, including
  upstream's suppression rule for a partially rendered last entry.
- Device-style rows: `Row::config` renders `▼ profile` on the detail line
  (`DeviceWidget` layout).
- `Theme::get`/`CharSet::get` with `ThemeName`/`CharSetName`, plus `--theme
  default|nocolor|plain` and `--char-set`, matching upstream's flags.
- `tests/compliance.rs` (upstream-pinned constants/geometry) and
  `tests/dropdown.rs` (dropdown replays).

### Changed
- List density: node geometry follows the data via `NodeMetrics`. A tab whose
  rows carry no volume, enabled peaks or config line renders compact nodes
  (1 line + 1 blank row, pitch 2, selector `░`), so the launcher and friends
  show 9 entries at 80x24 instead of 3; any row with detail data restores
  upstream's full 3-line `░▒░` node. Node internals are now written line by
  line rather than through a `Layout` split, which a solver reordered when the
  node area was shorter than the selector.
- **Node row contents now match upstream**: header on node line 1, an empty
  line 2 carrying `▒`, and the volume/meter or config line on line 3. The
  `◇` default marker occupies column 2 and titles start at column 4; the
  right column is the row's current target (or `meta`), right-aligned in the
  terminal default style rather than dimmed.
- The volume line shows the 5-cell right-aligned `NN%` (or `muted`) with the
  bar after it, sized by `max_volume_percent` (default 150 %) — the previous
  hard-coded decorative 75 % bar is gone, so rows without volume data leave
  the detail line empty.
- Oversized titles now get upstream's 3-cell `...` area instead of a single
  `…`, and oversized metadata is clipped by the layout instead of being
  dropped to `…` with a stderr note.
- Tab bar: `title + 2` widths, `[active]` / ` inactive `, inactive tabs keep
  the terminal default foreground, no extra separator, no `BOLD`.
- Help overlay: no title on the border, default-coloured border, `rows + 2`
  capped at 90 % of the list area, border `•••` indicators, scrollable while
  open (`Enter` closes).
- The list reserves a line above and below for `•••`, so the first entry sits
  on row 1 and one row fewer entry fits per screen.
- The gauge's muted state now shows `muted` instead of an unchanging `▮`
  glyph.
- Crate is now `rustfmt`-clean (`cargo fmt --check` reports zero diffs).

### Fixed
- Selected-row selector no longer repeats down the row gap: the two spacing
  lines that separate entries are now drawn blank, so the selection block is
  exactly `░▒░` on the node's three lines (header/empty/detail) instead of
  `░▒░░░` (`draw_node_row` sent `line_in_row` 2, 3 and 4 to the
  selector-drawing spacing row).
- `place_cursor` no longer underflows on degenerate frames (1x1), which
  panicked instead of rendering an empty frame.
- `MUTE_ON`/`MUTE_OFF` were both `▮`, so the gauge's mute indicator never
  changed.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-15

M6 power cutover + v1 hardening: all six providers cut over, 184 tests
green in debug AND release, hygiene gates clean.

### Added
- M6 power cutover: `src/providers/power.rs` (static 5-row System/Power
  table with `power-menu.sh` row-set parity — bash-exact order/labels/
  metas/ids, danger on Reboot/Power Off via the shared double-Enter flow)
  + `wrappers/flex-power.sh` (bash-verbatim power commands post-TUI with
  a `DRY_RUN=1` blast-radius gate: echoes `would run: …` instead of
  executing); `SUPER+M` + waybar `custom/power` repointed, `power-menu.sh`
  deleted, then `flex-tui.sh` deleted (zero functional sourcers remain).
  `tests/power.rs` (18 tests: row parity, danger safety replays incl. the
  single-`Enter`-never-confirms release gate, goldens, dry-run + dispatch)
  + 2 provider unit tests.
- M6 hardening: `tests/keys.rs` seed table 12 → 29 cases (`TODO(M6)`
  closed) + empty-app/empty-tab targeted tests; render-path audit (no
  subprocess/`tput`/`stty` in the render path); release suite 184/184;
  `target/release/flex` 984K (`strip`/`lto`/`abort` effective).

### Changed
- Version `1.0.0`. `README.md` cutover table all ✅. Frozen decisions
  recorded (`Docs/Implementation.md`): Q3 50 ms + 5 s danger timing,
  Q8 no serde.

### Removed
- `waybar/power-menu.sh` (superseded by `flex-power.sh`).
- `scripts/flex-tui.sh` (bash engine; last consumer cut over).
- Kept intentionally (out of scope): `popup.sh` (kill-menu /
  wallpaper-picker / wifi still exec it), `picker-chrome.sh`
  (wallpaper-picker fzf flow sources it), `app-cache.sh` (row-set
  reference), `kill-menu.sh` + `wallpaper-picker.sh` (non-flex surfaces).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- M0 scaffold: crate layout, `ACTION:` protocol contract, `TestBackend` golden harness.
- M2 launch cutover: `.desktop` provider (`src/providers/launch.rs`) with
  `app-cache.sh` row-set parity, `Terminal` meta, `%X`-preserving `Exec`;
  event loop (`src/run.rs`: 1 s poll, `handle_key` dispatch, per-frame
   render, `tick` expiry, `ACTION:`/`ACTION:DELETE`/quit exits, `FLEX_TEST`
   seeded step); hidden `--filter-mode=spec|legacy` escape hatch; `Tab::deletable`
   gate (launch rows non-deletable); `wrappers/flex-launch.sh` wrapper with
   `launch_app_row` launch semantics; `tests/launch.rs` (fixtures, key-seq
   replays, 80x24 golden, seed determinism, live-cache parity probe).
- M3 shot cutover: `src/providers/shot.rs` (7-row `Capture` table, exact bash
  labels/metas, `case`-arm ids) + `wrappers/flex-shot.sh` (capture pipeline
  verbatim, post-TUI execution); `SUPER+s` repointed, `screenshot.sh` deleted;
  `tests/shot.rs` (row parity, golden, replays, stubbed-pipeline wrapper tests).
- M3 theme cutover: `src/providers/theme_.rs` (sorted `available/` scan,
  wallpaper-basename meta + `Active` mark, std-only JSON) +
  `wrappers/flex-theme.sh` (`exec theme-switcher.sh activate`); `SUPER+T`
  repointed, `pick()` reduced to a delegating stub (`list/current/activate/
  delete/rofi` intact); `tests/theme.rs` (fixtures incl. live-shaped scan,
  golden, replays, dispatch wrapper tests).
- M4 clip cutover: `src/providers/clip.rs` (byte-safe `cliphist` ingest —
  `NUL`/`0x1F`/`ESC` dropped, `\t`→space, lossy UTF-8, pins-first then
  `tac` history, 120-char preview, content-hash ids, `📌 Pinned` meta,
  standard deletable rows, `CLIPHIST_FILE`/`CLIPHIST_PINS` overrides,
  hidden `flex clip --resolve` lookup) + `KeyOutcome::Toggle` /
  `ACTION:TOGGLE` (NAVIGATE `m` on deletable tabs; `backend::emit_toggle`,
  `run` handling) + `wrappers/flex-clip.sh` (post-TUI `wl-copy`/delete/
  pin-unpin with `cliphist.sh` semantics); `SUPER+SHIFT+V` repointed,
  `cliphist.sh pick()` a delegating stub (`add`/`pin`/`unpin` intact);
  `tests/clip.rs` (22 tests incl. live-store parity probe) + enforced
  `tests/clip_perf.rs` cold-ingest gate (6.4 ms vs 0.5 s budget).
- M5 center cutover: `src/providers/center.rs` (5-tab `Menu` builder with
  `control-center.sh` row-set parity — Launchers via the shared
  `.desktop` scan, `nmcli`/`bluetoothctl` snapshot parses, static power
  rows with shared danger-arm/confirm, volume/brightness gauge rows +
  theme rows; `CENTER_*` file seams; 1 s in-place gauge tick, R7) +
  `Row::offline` per-row dim flag (`lib.rs`/`render.rs`) +
  `wrappers/flex-center.sh` (launch/wifi-connect+password/bt-toggle/
  power-ops/mute/theme-activate with `control-center.sh` semantics);
  `SUPER+X` repointed, `control-center.sh` deleted (`app-cache.sh` kept
  as row-set reference, `flex-tui.sh`/`popup.sh` kept for power/kill/
  wallpaper flows); `tests/center.rs` (27 tests: per-tab fixtures,
  125x30 golden + gauge states, key-seq replays incl. 60-tick soak,
  stubbed-pipeline wrapper tests) + `tests/fixtures/center/` snapshots.
